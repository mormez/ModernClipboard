## 1. Overview

Modern Clipboard is a lightweight menu bar app that keeps a history of everything you copy and lets you paste any previous item in seconds. It also stores reusable text snippets organized in folders — think boilerplate responses, code templates, or frequently used strings — all accessible through a keyboard-driven popup.

**What it does:**

- Silently monitors your clipboard in the background
- Stores up to 50 copied items (text, rich text, images, file paths)
- Provides a fast keyboard-driven popup to browse and paste any history item
- Organizes reusable snippets in named folders
- Excludes sensitive apps (e.g., password managers) from capture
- Lives entirely in the menu bar — no Dock icon, no interruptions

---

## 2. Requirements & Installation

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| macOS | 15.0 (Sequoia) or later |
| Architecture | Apple Silicon (arm64) |
| App Store | No — distributed independently |
| Sandbox | No |

**To install:** Copy `Modern Clipboard.app` to your `/Applications` folder and double-click to launch.

**Launch at login:** Enabled by default on new installs. To turn it off, disable **Preferences → General → Launch Modern Clipboard at login**.

---

## 3. First Launch & Permissions

Modern Clipboard requires **Accessibility permission** to simulate the paste keystroke (⌘V, i.e. Command-V) on your behalf. Without it, you can browse history but pasting will not work.

### Granting Accessibility Permission

1. On first launch, macOS displays a permission prompt — click **Open System Settings**.
2. In **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**, find **Modern Clipboard** and toggle it on.
3. You may be asked to enter your password.

If you missed the prompt, open **Preferences** (⌘, — Command-Comma — from the menu bar), go to the **General** tab, and click **Open System Settings** next to the Accessibility status indicator.

**Status indicators in Preferences:**

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ✓ (green) | Permission granted — paste works |
| ⚠ (orange) | Permission missing — click to open Settings |

---

## 4. The Menu Bar Icon

Modern Clipboard adds a clipboard icon to your menu bar. Clicking it opens a traditional dropdown menu.

### Menu Structure

```
Clipboard History          ← section header
  1. [first item preview]  ⌘1
  2. [second item preview] ⌘2
  …
────────────────────────
  Snippets ▶              ← submenu per folder
    [snippet 1]
    [snippet 2]
    …
    Edit Snippets…
────────────────────────
  Check for Updates…
  Help & Feedback…
  Preferences…            ⌘,
  Quit Modern Clipboard    ⌘Q
```

(⌘1, ⌘2, … = Command-1, Command-2; ⌘, = Command-Comma; ⌘Q = Command-Q)

- Items 1–9 have keyboard shortcuts (⌘1 through ⌘9, i.e. Command-1 through Command-9) when the menu is open.
- Click any history item or snippet to paste it into your frontmost application.
- Each snippet folder's submenu ends with **Edit Snippets…**, which opens the snippet editor (see §6).
- **Help & Feedback…** opens Preferences with the Help tab selected (see §8).
- Clearing your clipboard history is done from **Preferences → General**, not from this menu (see §5 "Clearing History").

> **Tip:** The popup (⇧⌘V, i.e. Shift-Command-V) is faster for navigating large histories — the menu is best for quick one-click access to recent items.

---

## 5. Clipboard History

### How Capturing Works

Modern Clipboard polls the clipboard every 0.5 seconds. When it detects new content, it saves a copy.

**Supported content types** (in order of priority):

| Type | How it appears |
|------|----------------|
| Images | "[Image]" label with thumbnail |
| File URLs | Filename (or full path if no filename) |
| Plain text | First 100 characters of content |
| Rich text (RTF) | Plain text extracted from markup |
| HTML | Plain text extracted from markup |

**Deduplication:** Copying the same content twice does not create a duplicate. The existing entry moves to the top of the list instead.

**Empty content:** Blank clipboard entries are silently discarded.

**Preserving formatting:** Copied rich text (bold, italics, links, colors, etc. from apps like Word, Pages, Mail, or a web browser) is always captured along with its original formatting. By default, pasting an item restores that formatting; to paste plain text instead, use the paste-and-match-style modifier (see "Paste and Match Style" below).

### The History Popup

Press **⇧⌘V** (Shift-Command-V; default; customizable) anywhere to open the history popup.

The popup has two panels:

- **Left — Folder/Group panel:** Groups of items (e.g., "1 – 10", "11 – 20") or a flat list, depending on your display mode setting.
- **Right — Items panel:** The items inside the selected group.

#### Navigating the Popup

**Folder/Group level:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↓ / ↑ | Move between groups |
| → or ⏎ (Return) | Open selected group |
| 1 – 9 | Jump directly to item (flat mode only) |
| Esc (Escape) | Close popup |

**Item level (inside a group):**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↓ / ↑ | Move between items |
| ⏎ (Return) | Paste selected item |
| 1 – 9 | Paste item at that position |
| ← or Esc (Escape) | Return to group list |

You can also use the mouse: hover to highlight, click to select or paste.

#### History Display Modes

Configure in **Preferences → General → History Menu Style**:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|---------|
| Always in subfolders | Items always grouped as "1 – 10", "11 – 20", … |
| First 10 flat, older in subfolders | Top 10 shown directly; older items in groups |
| Flat when 10 or fewer | Single flat list if ≤ 10 items; switches to groups above 10 |

#### How Pasting Works

1. Select an item and press ⏎ (Return), or click.
2. The popup closes immediately.
3. The app you were using before the popup is brought to the front.
4. Modern Clipboard sets the clipboard to the selected item.
5. A ⌘V (Command-V) keystroke is sent to paste it.
6. The clipboard monitor pauses briefly (1.5 s) to avoid re-capturing the pasted content.

> **Note:** Steps 4 and 5 require Accessibility permission. If paste does not work, check the permission status in Preferences.

#### Paste and Match Style

Since formatting is always captured (see "Preserving formatting" above), you can paste any item as plain text on demand instead: hold down the **paste-and-match-style modifier** (⌥ Option by default; configurable in **Preferences → Hotkeys**) while pressing ⏎ (Return) or clicking the item. This strips all formatting and pastes plain text only.

A hint in the popup (e.g., "⌥ to match style") shows the currently configured modifier key.

#### Sorting History

In **Preferences → General → Sort Order**, choose:

- **Date Created** — newest copied item is always at the top (default)
- **Last Used** — items you paste most recently float to the top

#### Clearing History

Go to **Preferences → General → Clipboard History** and click **Clear History…**. A confirmation dialog appears, warning that this permanently deletes all clipboard history and cannot be undone.

---

## 6. Snippets

Snippets are reusable pieces of text you save manually. Unlike history items, they persist until you delete them and are organized in named folders.

### Opening the Snippets Popup

Press **⇧⌘S** (Shift-Command-S; default; customizable) anywhere to open the snippets popup.

Navigation is identical to the history popup:

- Left panel shows your snippet folders.
- Right panel shows snippets in the selected folder.
- ↓/↑ to move, → or ⏎ (Return) to open a folder, ⏎ (Return) to paste a snippet, ← or Esc (Escape) to go back.

### Managing Snippets — The Editor

Open the snippet editor via **Edit Snippets…**, which appears in any of these places:

- At the bottom of a folder's items panel in the **snippets popup** (⇧⌘S).
- At the bottom of a snippet folder's items panel in the **clipboard history popup** (⇧⌘V).
- Inside a folder's submenu in the **menu bar icon's dropdown** (see §4).

The editor has three columns:

#### Folders (left column)

- **+** — Create a new folder (enter a name in the dialog)
- **−** — Delete the selected folder and all its snippets
- **✏** — Rename the selected folder
- Drag rows to reorder folders

#### Snippets (middle column)

With a folder selected on the left:

- **+** — Add a new snippet (enter title and content in the dialog)
- **−** — Delete the selected snippet
- Drag rows to reorder snippets within the folder

#### Detail Editor (right column)

Click any snippet to edit it:

- **Title** — The name shown in menus and the popup
- **Content** — The text that gets pasted (supports multi-line)
- **Save** — Appears when you have unsaved changes; click to save

> **Tip:** On first launch, Modern Clipboard creates a "My Snippets" folder as a starting point. Rename or delete it freely.

2. Click the hotkey button you want to change (it turns red and shows "Press shortcut…").
3. Press your desired key combination (must include at least one modifier: ⌘ Command, ⌥ Option, ⇧ Shift, or ⌃ Control).
4. The new shortcut is registered immediately.
5. Press **Restore Default** to revert to the original hotkey.

> Press Esc (Escape) while recording to cancel without changing the hotkey.

---

## 8. Preferences

Open Preferences with ⌘, (Command-Comma) or via the menu bar menu.

### General Tab

#### Permissions

Shows whether Accessibility permission has been granted. Click **Open System Settings** if it hasn't.

#### Clipboard History

| Setting | Options | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| History Menu Style | Three modes (see §5) | Always in subfolders | How items are grouped in popup and menu |
| Max History Items | 5 – 50 | 20 | Maximum items kept; oldest are trimmed automatically |
| Items Panel Width | 200 – 600 px | 400 px | Width of the right panel in the popup |
| Preview Lines | 1 – 3 | 2 | Lines of text shown per item in the popup |
| Sort Order | Date Created / Last Used | Date Created | How history is ordered |

#### Startup

**Launch Modern Clipboard at login** — registers the app with macOS Login Items so it starts automatically when you log in. Enabled by default on new installs.

#### Hotkeys

Two hotkey recorders — one for the history popup, one for the snippets popup. Click either to record a new shortcut. Click **Restore Default** to go back to ⇧⌘V (Shift-Command-V) or ⇧⌘S (Shift-Command-S).

**Paste and match style modifier** — choose which modifier key (⌥ Option, ⌃ Control, ⇧ Shift, or ⌘ Command) forces plain-text pasting from the history popup for that one paste, instead of the formatted version. Default is ⌥ Option. See §5 "Paste and Match Style."

---

### Exclude Apps Tab

Some apps (particularly password managers) place sensitive data on the clipboard. Modern Clipboard can be told to ignore clipboard changes from these apps entirely.

**To add an app:**

1. Go to **Preferences → Exclude Apps**.
2. Click **+** to open a file picker (opens `/Applications` by default).
3. Select the app you want to exclude.

**To auto-exclude common password managers:**

Click **Auto-exclude known password managers**. This immediately adds the following apps (if installed):

- 1Password (v7 and v8)
- Bitwarden
- LastPass
- Dashlane
- KeePassXC
- Strongbox
- NordPass
- RoboForm
- Enpass
- Keeper
- Proton Pass

**To remove an exclusion:** Click the **−** button next to any app in the list.

Each row shows the app icon, display name, and bundle ID so you can easily identify entries.

---

### Help Tab

Where to go when something goes wrong or you have an idea:

- **Report a Bug…** — opens a pre-addressed email to report an issue
- **Request a Feature…** — opens a pre-addressed email to suggest something new
- **Export Diagnostics…** — saves a diagnostics log file (settings snapshot and recent activity) to ~/Downloads; attach this to a bug report to help track down what went wrong
- **Documentation** — download buttons for the **Quick Start Guide** and **User Manual** (`.docx`), defaulting to ~/Downloads

### About Tab

Shows app version, developer info, and contact email. Contains:

- **Check for Updates…** — manually trigger an update check
- **Copyright** — view the open-source MIT license

---

## 9. Excluding Apps

Clipboard monitoring respects the exclusion list on a per-app basis. When a copied item is detected, Modern Clipboard checks which app is currently frontmost. If that app's bundle ID is in the exclusion list, the item is silently skipped — it never enters history and cannot be pasted from Modern Clipboard.

This is most important for:

- Password managers (auto-fill passwords, credit card numbers)
- Banking or sensitive form apps
- Any app where you frequently copy private data

> **How it works technically:** Modern Clipboard checks the frontmost app's bundle ID at capture time, not at paste time. Exclusion only affects recording; if an item was already in history, it remains there.

---

## 10. Automatic Updates

Modern Clipboard uses the **Sparkle** framework for software updates.

- Background checks happen automatically at startup.
- You can trigger a manual check via **menu bar → Check for Updates…** or **Preferences → About → Check for Updates…**
- When an update is available, a standard Sparkle dialog appears with release notes and an option to install.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Paste does nothing / clipboard not updated

**Cause:** Accessibility permission not granted.

**Fix:** Open **Preferences → General** and look for the ⚠ orange warning next to Accessibility. Click **Open System Settings**, find Modern Clipboard in the list, and enable it.

---

### History popup doesn't open on ⇧⌘V (Shift-Command-V)

**Possible causes and fixes:**

1. **Permission conflict:** Another app may have registered the same hotkey. Try changing Modern Clipboard's hotkey in **Preferences → Hotkeys**.
2. **App not running:** Check that the clipboard icon is visible in the menu bar.
3. **Hotkey was changed:** Open **Preferences → Hotkeys** to see the current hotkey and press **Restore Default** if needed.

---

### Copied items not appearing in history

**Possible causes:**

1. **App is excluded:** The app you copied from may be on the exclusion list. Check **Preferences → Exclude Apps**.
2. **Duplicate item:** The item already exists in history and moved to the top silently.
3. **Empty content:** Blank or whitespace-only clipboard entries are discarded.
4. **History is full:** If the list is full and you lowered the max items, old items may have been trimmed. Increase **Max History Items** in Preferences.

---

### Snippets not appearing in the popup

Open **Edit Snippets…** and verify your snippets are saved (check that the **Save** button is not showing unsaved changes). Ensure the folder containing your snippets exists and is not empty.

---

### App excluded by mistake

Go to **Preferences → Exclude Apps**, find the app in the list, and click the **−** button next to it.

---

### Images show as "[Image]" instead of a preview

This is expected. The popup shows a small thumbnail (18×18 px) and the "[Image]" label. Full image preview is not supported in the popup — paste the item to see the full image in the target app.

---

### Clearing history to start fresh

Go to **Preferences → General → Clipboard History**, click **Clear History…**, and confirm. This is permanent and cannot be undone.
